# Calculator

Calculator inspired by IOS design

    Simple project created with Vanilla JS, HTML and CSS.

    Helped solidify knowledge of:
        1) DOM manipulation and event listeners
        2) CSS Grid
        3) JS functions

    Future features:
        1) Add +/- functionality
        2) Add % functionality
        3) Refactor for cleaner, maintainable code.
